    "In this Assignment, you will use Python to handle several exercises related to gradient descent, linear regression, logistic regression, etc.\n",
    "All exercises are individual. \n",
    "We expect you to submit a Jupyter Notebook (i.e., pre-organized and provided through Moodle) and the .py files with the classes’ exercise implementations. \n",
    "Your submission should include all the datasets and files we need to run your programs (we will run your notebook). \n",
    "When grading your assignments, we will, in addition to functionality, also take into account code quality. \n",
    "We expect well-structured and efficient solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you must implement all models as subclasses of MachineLearning-\n",
    "Model. \n",
    "Since the class MachineLearningModel provides the abstract methods fit, predict,\n",
    "and evaluate, your implementations should provide implementations for such methods.\n",
    "Please check the documentation of MachineLearningModel to understand what these methods\n",
    "should do, as well as what their input parameters are and what they should return as results.\n",
    "You must also implement the classes DecisionBoundary, ROCAnalysis, and ForwardSelection\n",
    "provided to you. \n",
    "Please check their documentation to understand what these methods\n",
