    "**email:** sm224cb@student.lnu.se\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Assignment, you will use Python to handle several exercises related to gradient descent, linear regression, logistic regression, etc.\n",
    "All exercises are individual. \n",
    "We expect you to submit a Jupyter Notebook (i.e., pre-organized and provided through Moodle) and the .py files with the classes’ exercise implementations. \n",
    "Your submission should include all the datasets and files we need to run your programs (we will run your notebook). \n",
    "When grading your assignments, we will, in addition to functionality, also take into account code quality. \n",
    "We expect well-structured and efficient solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you must implement all models as subclasses of MachineLearning-\n",
    "Model. \n",
    "Since the class MachineLearningModel provides the abstract methods fit, predict,\n",
    "and evaluate, your implementations should provide implementations for such methods.\n",
    "Please check the documentation of MachineLearningModel to understand what these methods\n",
    "should do, as well as what their input parameters are and what they should return as results.\n",
    "You must also implement the classes DecisionBoundary, ROCAnalysis, and ForwardSelection\n",
    "provided to you. \n",
    "Please check their documentation to understand what these methods\n",
    "should do, what their input parameters are, and what they should return as results. All your\n",

    "### Guidelines for model implementation (Mandatory)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement a class **RegressionModelNormalEquation** that implements the abstract\n",
    "class **MachineLearningModel**. All methods should be implemented and properly documented.\n",
    "This class must work for polynomials of any degree (i.e., an input parameter that\n",
    "must be captured in the class constructor).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement a class **RegressionModelGradientDescent** that implements the abstract\n",
    "class **MachineLearningModel**. All methods should be implemented and properly documented.\n",
    "This class must work for polynomials of any degree and receive other parameters\n",
    "such as the learning rate and number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Both implementations should be vectorized. When implementing these classes, your\n",
    "vector β should start with all values as 0. In implementing the fit() method, ensure\n",
    "you track how the cost function evolved over the number of iterations (i.e., store it in an\n",
    "array you can retrieve after the model is built). This will be needed later in the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation of your model implementation (1-4 Mandatory, 5-6 Non-mandatory)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **(Mandatory)** In this part, you will use a reduced version of the Boston Housing Dataset (housingboston.csv). We will use the first two input variables as the features in this part of the assignment. The last variable is the value to predict.\n",
    "* **INDUS:** proportion of nonretail business acres per town.\n",
    "* **RM:** average number of rooms per dwelling.\n",
    "* **MEDV:** Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1,000s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the dataset and store the values as vectors in the variables $X_e$ and $y$. For this part of the assignment, the degree of the polynomial for your models must be 1."
